## About me

Also known as `Hackerchai`.

Intern at [Qiniu](https://www.qiniu.com/), previously at [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/). I am a backend developer as well as a Barcelona fans. Besides, I am also an open-source enthusiast and [GSoC 2020 Student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5810607317581824). I speak Chinese and English.

I am focusing on these social issues: `Human Rights`, `Liberty`, `Privacy`, `Copyright`, `Information transparency`.
